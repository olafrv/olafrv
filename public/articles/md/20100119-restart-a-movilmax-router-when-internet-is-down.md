I've created a Linux shell script to automatically restart a Movilmax router (pictured above) when the Internet gateway is down. This script can be scheduled in your crontab. You can download the script [here](/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/movilmax.tar.gz).

I'm sharing this script here in case you're experiencing stability issues with your WiMax signal and need a reliable solution to maintain your connection.
