Back in the day, we worked on a Flash game that was never fully completed. This project started on July 24, 2004, primarily developed by [Jos√© Carrero](mailto:josercl@gmail.com), with some input from me on [ActionScript and Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript). In the end, we achieved something cool and fun that I'll never forget.

You can download the [32-bit Windows executable compressed in ZIP format here](/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/nave.zip), which works with [Wine](www.winehq.org/) on GNU/Linux. The original Macromedia output file is also available [here](/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/nave.swf).

To convert the EXE to SWF for embedding here, I used the program [FardaSaz EXE to SWF](https://download.cnet.com/FardaSaz-EXE-to-SWF/3000-6676_4-10554387.html) by Aftab Developers, a company that seems to have disappeared without a trace.
