## Scenario

* Acer Aspire 3661 WLMi
* Ubuntu 7.04 Kernel version \[2.6\]

## Working out of the box

* Intel Celeron M 410 (1.46 Ghz, 533 MHz FSB, 1 MB L2 Cache) => Works
* 15.4 WXGA Crystal Brite LCD (16ms) => Works
* Integrated ATI Mobility Xpress 200M (using RAM memory, AGP/PCI configurable)
* 1 GB, 2 SO DIMM, 512 MB each one. The first by Acer, the second by Hitachi.
* MK8032GAX 80 GBytes Hard Drive by Toshiba
* Integrated Gigabit Ethernet LAN by Marvell Yukon Chipset
* Integrated AR5005G 802.11b/g Wireless LAN by Atheros
* Integrated SDVD8821 DVD-Super Multi double layer (support DVD-R Double Layer/DVD+RW, CD+RW) by Phillips
* Integrated PS/2 Touchpad by Synaptics
* Integrated PCMCIA PCIxx12 FlashMedia Controller by Texas Instruments
* USB Bus & Hub (4 Ports)
* 14.8V 2000 mAh Lithium-Ion Battery by Sanyo
* PCI High Definition Audio 883 by Realtek => Download, compile and install ALSA driver 1.0.14 or better 1.0.16 manually, because the ubuntu files doesn't work properly.

## Does not work or not tested

* Integrated Acer Orbicam 3 Mpxls by Bison => Gave Up. No open source kernel modules available.
* Integrated HDA 56k Modem by Agere Systems => Unused by the laptop owner => No information about in Linux.
* Integrated PCMCIA PCIxx12 Cardbus Controller by Texas Instruments => Only used on Windows => No information about in Linux

## Basic Installation of Ubuntu 7.04

*   Ubuntu is really easy to use but use restricted drivers to make hardware works properly.
*   Ubuntu is a son of a totally GNU/GPL Debian Linux ([www.debian.org](http://www.debian.org)).
*   Ubuntu is downloable from [www.ubuntu.com](http://www.ubuntu.com)

## Setting up additional features for Ubuntu 7.04

*   You must download and install ALSA driver for linux manually from [www.alsa-project.org](http://www.alsa-project.org). 
*   I tested the versions 1.0.14 y 1.0.16 which make the sound works fine, as I said ALSA files installed by Ubuntu doesn't work properly in most cases.
    
## Unresolved issues

*   I never used and don't need the modem on Linux.
*   I can't configure the integrated webcam, although 'lsusb' command shows the Acer Orbicam vendor info.
*   I never try to use my pcmcia's cards on Linux, my cards only works with windows softwares and drivers.
