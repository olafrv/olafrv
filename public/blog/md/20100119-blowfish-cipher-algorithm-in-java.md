### Java Version

* The Blowfish cipher algorithm is a symmetric-key block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier. It operates on 64-bit blocks and supports key sizes from 32 bits to 448 bits. It is known for its efficiency and strong security.
* You can download the source code for this implementation [here](/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Blowfish.tar.gz).
